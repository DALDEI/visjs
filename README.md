Vis.js is a dynamic, browser based visualization library. The library is designed to be easy to use, to handle large amounts of dynamic data, and to enable manipulation of and interaction with the data. The library consists of the components DataSet, Timeline, Network, Graph2d, and Graph3d.

The vis.js library is developed by Almende B.V, as part of CHAP. Vis.js runs fine on Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari, IE9+, and most mobile browsers (with full touch support).

http://visjs.org contains documentation, downloads and live examples of vis.js. The sourcecode of vis.js is available at Github. For questions, issues, and suggestions please use the issues section of the Github project.
